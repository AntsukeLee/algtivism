## Algtivism

Algtivism is a social project aimed to storm the search results of search engines by normalizing inclusion and diversity. Feel free to fork it but use it responsibly.

To make it easier, I've set up all you'll need in order to have a basic running website.

You have 3 files:
- index.html --- template, content, images
- style.css --- styling, fonts
- script.js --- anything JavaScript you wish

Once you forked and cloned the repo, open it in an IDE of your choice and search in the ```index.html``` for *FILL IN* - I left those around as hints as to where you could change some things to have an impact on the SEO (apart from the content of the page itself).

Feel free to add/remove things as you wish, go wild, but be responsible ;)

### How to publish

Easiest way is to have a this repository forked (in top right corner "FORK") to your GitHub account, clone it to your machine, adjust it a bit, push back to GitHub and go to the page of your repo, navigate to settings > GitHub Pages > in the source choose ```master branch``` and save! In some minutes your website should be up and running.

### Examples

I'll keep all the websites you create in a list here below, so once you have it live, submit a PR request with a link to your created website and it'll appear here!

### Content of choice

You are free to use any content you find (don't forget to check for copyrights!) but I'll keep below some guides or phrases/words you can use in case you want to.

#### Meta tags 

_*TIP*_: type in the search engine the term the results of which you wish to change, navigate to an example of your choice, click on the page to get the dropdown menu (right/left click on the mouse depending on your preferences) and choose ```View Page Source```. Now press Command + F or Ctrl + F and search for ```title``` and then ```description``` and here you go!
